\subsection{Definition}

TODO. Here the main definition is introduced, and how it relates to ``path deletion'',
including the core example of $A \rightarrow X \rightarrow Y$, with two latent
variables $U_x \rightarrow X$ and $U_y \rightarrow Y$, arguing that one might judge
that the path from $A$ to $Y$ via is due to an unfair mechanism and that we need a
notion of ``closest world''.

\subsection{Other Examples}

TODO. Here the examples and their motivation can be as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item something analogous to the red car example: $A$ is not a cause of
  $Y$ but might indirectly bias the result even without using $A$ as a predictor;
\item something with selection bias, maybe a toy version of COMPAS;
\item something where an unfair judgement (say, credit score) that can be potentially
  considered as a target variable, and an
  ``objective target'' (say, defaulting on a loan) are present, and
  what the recommendation is
\end{itemize}
